Hello, **stranger**!

Welcome to my website, which I created alongside my YouTube channel, *Reminiscence Ramparts*.
My main platform is [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@RemRamp), where I post long-form videos, but I also enjoy taking photos and making short clips, those usually end up on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/remramp) page.

**Oh, where are my manners?** A few words about myself…
If it’s not already obvious from the profile pictures and the quotes, I love *Evangelion*, my favorite color is **purple**, and my constant emotional state hovers somewhere around **depression**.

Since I **love** talking about video games, it’s been a long-time dream of mine to start a channel about them. There’s no strict theme when it comes to the games I choose, but the main thing I look for is whether they make me feel something and if they do, it often leads to a bit of reminiscing or nostalgia. That’s where the name *Reminiscence Ramparts* comes from.

Besides that, I want to use this site (or blog, if you will) as a place for more casual, free-form posts. Lately, I’ve started experimenting with short stories, and I’d also like to write about and briefly analyze books I read. Sometimes I’ll also share a few thoughts on things happening around me or in the world.

<!-- YYYYY your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
